### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

A challenge I encountered while building this app was creating the launch screen. I decided to not use main.storyboard and deleted it along with launchscreen. I needed to create a new LaunchScreen.storyboard but by default it is named "Launch Screen" with the space. In info.plist there is a key "Launch screen interface file base name" that holds a value of "LaunchScreen" that needed to be changed to "Launch Screen".

Another challenge was using AutoLayout programmatically.
